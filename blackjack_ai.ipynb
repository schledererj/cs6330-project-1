    "For a control experiment, we'll build a Blackjack player who, per basic Blackjack strategy, hits up to 17, then stands. The dealer will also play this way. This is a _simplified_ version of Blackjack, where we'll treat the deck as a \"continuous shuffle\" shoe, meaning that each card dealt is a random choice from 52 cards, meaning that the same card twice in a row is possible, but very improbable (though it would be an interesting future experiment to observe how the policy changes should the game use 1-, 2-, 4-deck shoes (and so on) with shuffling taking place when the deck is exhausted). We'll simulate 1,000 hands and see how the player performs."

    "\n",
    "As a casino game, the rules of Blackjack set up to give the dealer (the _house_) an advantage (an _edge_). Meaning that, after enough games, we'll observe the house averaging out to win a certain percentage over 50%, but never under (hence why gambling is always a bad decision). In a real game of Blackjack, i.e with good player strategy, splits, double-downs, 3:2 payouts on natural Blackjacks, etc, this can be well under 5%, but for this first pass, we got 8.6%. Let's measure the house edge in the following experiments to see if a player whose moves are governed by a Q-learning policy can learn to play better, quantitatively measured by a reduction in the house edge.\n",
